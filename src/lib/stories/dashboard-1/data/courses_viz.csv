This course takes a broad view of what the “digital” means within digital anthropology, exploring both how anthropological theory and method can deepen our understanding of digital technologies, practices, and infrastructures, and how digital tools and approaches can, in turn, transform the practice of anthropology. Students will read classic anthropological work and we will examine the social and cultural dimensions of digital phenomenon—from memes to algorithmic governance—through the lens of these foundational texts and concepts. Students will also read notable and recent publications specific to the field of digital anthropology. Through our engagements with this work throughout the course, we will discover and debate what studies of online communities, socio-technical systems, and social media activities can contribute to wider anthropological conversations about what it means to be human. Alongside these discussions, we will consider the potentials and challenges of digital approaches to anthropological inquiry. From #hashtag ethnography to ethnographically-grounded computational discourse analysis, we will explore the methodological and ethical considerations of an anthropology that leverages digital tools or centers digital subjects. Altogether, this course provides an exploration of both how anthropology can study the digital, as well as how the digital might offer opportunities to reimagine what anthropology is and can be.",2.0142136,8.613733

It dominated the age of exploration, anchored the two biggest wars the world has ever seen, and has consistently been at the forefront of clashes of cultures and the Global West and East, the dominant world order and “the Other.” Of course, these dichotomies are never clear-cut, and they under-serve a rich, vast history of languages, religions, and customs regarded as the forefront of the modern world. This course provides an introduction to the human and physical geography of Europe, investigating people and their relationships with the environment. We will discuss historical, political, social, and cultural understandings of Europe, focusing on a historical perspective to better understand contemporary European issues.

In the decades that followed, filmmakers began asking questions like: What does it mean to be German in a globalized world? How can you look forward while still reckoning with the past? And how can cinema capture life in a post-Wall society shaped by the promises and failures of neoliberalism—where freedom collides with precarity, and progress often comes at a human cost? From the kinetic rush of Lola rennt to the suffocating surveillance of The Lives of Others, post-Wall cinema traces Germany’s evolving sense of self. Films like Barbara and Undine turn quiet resistance into visual poetry, while Ich bin dein Mensch transforms questions of AI and intimacy into a meditation on what it means to be human. In Berlin Alexanderplatz, the struggle for survival and belonging spills beyond national borders, reframing migration and modernity for a new century. Together, these films reveal a nation both haunted by its past and hungry for new ways of imagining its future. In this course, we’ll explore how filmmakers and series creators since 1990 have reinvented what “German film” can be in a Europe without walls—but full of new boundaries. From the privatization of the 1990s film industry to today’s streaming revolution, we’ll examine how shifting technologies, audiences, and transnational collaborations continue to reshape German cinema’s aesthetics, circulation, and global reach. Through this course, students will: • Strengthen language proficiency in spoken and written German through discussion and analysis of film and culture. • Deepen understanding of key movements and themes in post-1990 German cinema within their historical and social contexts. • Analyze how filmmakers represent questions of identity, memory, and belonging in a reunified and globalized Germany. • Expand vocabulary and stylistic range for discussing film form, culture, and contemporary social issues. • Develop intercultural awareness by engaging German cinema as a lens for understanding broader European and global perspectives.",4.7728696,9.096045

The cultural production of this minority population is likewise extremely diverse, as Jews engage fully with the cultural life of Germany overall.

We will see a couple films prior to the revolution to give us a sense of what the revolution was against but after the first week or so, the class is devoted to what the director Tomás Gutiérrez Alea called ""the dialectics"" of Cuban cinema. After the 1959 revolution, Cuba produced what most if not all Latin American critics and audiences consider among the most important and best cinema in the world. While cinema became one of the most important, nationally funded art forms, it also questioned the revolution. The result is that the films represent a very dynamic vision of Cuba that presents the viewers with more questions than answers. We will learn about the various phases of the revolution and Cuban history since 1959 and how cinema presents images that ask the viewer to imagine a better world.",4.5265784,9.33237

Distribution grid power systems will be the physical system for this course. The course begins with coverage of fundamentals of a) distribution grid analyses and b) circuit theory to represent the physical grid. We follow up with coverage of formulation and solution methodologies for various distribution grid analyses. In the first section, you will learn how to construct time-domain models and perform time-domain analyses for distribution grid inverters. In the second part of the course, we will cover frequency domain analyses for distribution grids, namely, the unbalanced AC three-phase power flow problem. Finally, the course will conclude with the use of circuit methods for the optimization of distribution grids. In the third section, we will learn how to solve the three-phase optimal power flow problem following the circuit-theoretic optimization framework. Special topic lectures will also consider how the methods apply to other problems based on physical systems. Pre-requisites for this course: • Interest in solving computational problems in energy • Python • Linear algebra/systems • Circuits or energy systems This is a 3cr course - a minimum of 6-9 hours of outside the classroom work is expected.

While it will be edited in Spring 2026, the main material, such as lecture notes, homework assignments, and the information about midterm project papers, will remain (mostly) the same.In this course, several models of classical and modern science are considered starting, as much as possible, from the first principles. Examples include: Formation of rainbows, Motion on a roller-coaster, Input-output models in economics, Nonlinear pendula (including an inverted pendulum), Smoothing of noisy experimental data, and The black body radiation. The emphasis in describing each model is made on presenting mathematical techniques which are: (i) commonly used by applied mathematicians, physicists, and engineers, and (ii) are covered in the undergraduate courses on Calculus and Linear Algebra. Examples of such techniques are: linearization, Taylor series, and eigenvector expansions. Thus, one of the goals of this course is to show the students some real-world applications of these fundamental techniques.The other major goal of this course is to coach students on giving oral presentations. To this end, the course includes (instead of exams) two projects: a midterm and a final, where the students are to read a contemporary research paper (with some mathematical content) and give a presentation about it to the class. Before each presentation, every student is required to practice his/her talk in front of the instructor, and the instructor gives the feedback and advice on how to improve the talk. The feedback is also given after each presentation.There isnorequired textbook for this course. You will need to study the notes posted on the course website listed above.",0.66466475,0.38269594

Most of the world’s ecosystems have been degraded by people, but people can restore them. The difference between a degraded and restored ecosystem is human will and empowerment – do people want to restore their landscapes, and are they able to do it? This ability can only be realized through politics. Vermont has recently seen several major restoration policy changes - we will consider how they can best be implemented.We will see how and why stakeholders are restoring Vermont ecosystems, the interests and conflicts involved, and the political tactics they use. We will do this through a mix of classroom and field learning, studying restoration politics and seeing it applied, and engaging with the organizations and people who try to make restoration happen. We will debate what political strategies and policy tools might contribute to more intact, resilient ecosystems, and propose plans to support restoration. By the end of the course, you should gain the skills and knowledge to step into the world of landscape politics and management after UVM.
