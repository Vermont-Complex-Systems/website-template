# Custom Research Website Template

## Installation

You will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) (equivalent to `pip` or `CRAN`). installed to get things going. The easiest way to install node is by following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). If you are familiar with the command line interface, the easiest way to get started is to copy paste this code snippet in your terminal: 

```zsh
# Download and install nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

# in lieu of restarting the shell
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

# Download and install Node.js:
nvm install 24

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v24.13.0".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "11.6.2".
```

Once this is done, you should be able to simply run:

```zsh
npx degit Vermont-Complex-Systems/website-template example
```

If you want to use a specific branch, you can do

```zsh
npx degit Vermont-Complex-Systems/website-template#annotated-boxes example
```

We use this command to also provide simpler stages of a given story to learn from. From example, to see the barebone version of `scrolly-story-2`, you can do

```
npx degit jstonge1/website-template#scrolly-story-2-v1.0.1
```

## Goal

This is an experimental Template to scaffold web applications with data-driven visual essays. It aims to demonstrate techniques we do at the VCSI to do visual essays.

## Project structure

```zsh
src/
├── styles/
│   ├── app.css              # Global tokens, base styles, .page class
│   └── scrolly.css          # Scrolly patterns (.scrolly-with-chart, .scrolly-fullscreen)
│
├── routes/
│   └── +layout.svelte       # App shell: Nav + main + Footer (no constraints)
│
└── lib/
    ├── layouts/
    │   ├── PageLayout.svelte    # Centered pages (max-width, padding, nav offset)
    │   └── ScrollyLayout.svelte # Full-width stories (nav offset, .prose centering, section spacing)
    │
    └── components/
        ├── StoryHeader.svelte           # Reusable title/subtitle/authors/date block
        └── helpers/
            └── ScrollySnippets.svelte   # Scrolly content snippets (imports scrolly.css)

```

flow 

```zsh
+layout.svelte (shell)
    │
    ├── PageLayout         → About page, etc.
    │   └── .page class from app.css
    │
    └── ScrollyLayout      → Stories
        ├── StoryHeader
        ├── .prose sections (intro, conclusion)
        └── .scrolly-with-chart (from scrolly.css)
            ├── .scrolly-chart
            └── scrollyContent snippet
```

## Features

### Global

Particular settings provide some rough edges of the website, as put by [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/). 

 - Minimalist global styling in `src/styles/` directory: `app.css`, `variables.css`, `fonts.css` and `reset.css`. 
  - `Dark mode`: we favor users' preference using `ModeWatcher`, then use variables in our styling sheets to handle dark/light mode.
 - `Mobile-first philosophy:` we try as much as we can to make the webb app enjoyable on mobile, as most traffic comes from there.
 - Shared svelte components can be found in `src/lib/components`:
  - In `helpers/`, we have helper components:
    - `MarkdownRenderer.svelte` works in concert with copy.json to parse content as markdown, html, or maths.
    - `Scrolly.svelte` is the base component from The Pudding to do scrollytelling
    - `ScrollySnippets.svelte` combines the MarkdownRenderer and Scrolly components in [snippets](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/snippet) to facilitate reuse of established scrolly layout, i.e. content left-plot right, content top-plot underneath.

### Local

Inspired by The Pudding, each story lives in `src/lib/stories/story`:
  - Content is stored in a `data/copy.json`: when creating scrolly, key is the section name and values are list. Each entry in the list is a dictionary contains at least `type` (i.e. markdown, html, math) and `value`.
  - Stories can be found in `components/Index.svelte`. Each story contain local styling, which can sometimes need to overwrite the global styling.

## Sharepoint Site integration

You will need to setup the relevant secrets in a `.env` file. 

```zsh
mv .env.example .env
```

Then, the `.env` needs to contain the following

```
tenantId=
clientId=
clientSecret=
siteID=https://uvmoffice.sharepoint.com/sites/{sitename}/_api/site/id
```

The `tenanId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret` can be obtained by registring your Sharepoint Site via [https://entra.microsoft.com/](https://entra.microsoft.com/#home).
